## The Wing-Chun Academy

This fully responsive Website was built using GatsbyJS and React. I used both styled components and SASS for the styling and design of the site

The contact form is using Getform API as a backend and the there is also a map from Google-Maps. 

The blog element of this site is managed using Contentful CMS. 

Here are some screenshots of the site:
